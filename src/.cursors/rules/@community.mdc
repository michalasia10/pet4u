# Domain: Community (Places & Social)

This domain handles the "free" features of the application, focused on community-generated content and useful information for pet owners.

## Key Responsibilities:
- Managing a database of pet-friendly locations (e.g., parks, cafes, shops).
- Allowing users to submit new locations for approval.
- Allowing users to rate and review these community locations.
- Could potentially be expanded to include articles, forums, or other social features.

## Core Use Cases:
- A user looks for a dog-friendly park near their current location.
- A user submits a new pet-friendly cafe they discovered.
- A user reads reviews of a pet store before visiting.

## Relationships with Other Domains:
- **Users**: All community contributions are linked to a `User` profile.
- **Search**: The locations from this domain can be made available through the main `Search` interface, perhaps with a separate filter.
