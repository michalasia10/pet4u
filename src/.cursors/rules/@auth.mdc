# Domain: Auth (Authentication & Identity)

This domain is responsible for everything related to user identity, authentication, and authorization within the system.

## Key Responsibilities:
- Registering new users (both clients and business owners).
- Authenticating users via various methods (e.g., email/password, social logins like Google/Facebook).
- Logging users out and managing user sessions.
- Handling the password reset mechanism.
- Managing roles and permissions (e.g., `CLIENT`, `BUSINESS_OWNER`, `VET`, `GROOMER`, `ADMIN`).
- Protecting application endpoints and resources based on roles and authentication status.

## Core Use Cases:
- A user signs up for a new account.
- A user logs into the application.
- A user requests a password reset link.
- The system verifies a JWT with every request to a protected resource.

## Relationships with Other Domains:
- **Users**: Upon successful authentication, the `Auth` domain provides a user identifier, which is the key for operations within the `Users` domain.
- **Businesses**: Registering a "Business" type account initiates the creation of a business profile in the `Businesses` domain.
